/**
 * Records any additions, updates and deletions that occurred during relation raw Atlas slicing. We
 * try to keep this class as light-weight as possible. For additions, we rely on the
 * {@link TemporaryEntity} objects to keep track of the bare minimum needed to create Atlas
 * entities. This change set definition assumes that all individual ways and points have already
 * been sliced. The following cases are handled.
 * <ul>
 * <li>1. Point creation - if a new Line needs to be created, we need to create new shape points
 * <li>2. Line creation - new line can be created when multipolygons are sliced by a country
 * boundary
 * <li>3. Relation creation - new relations are created if an existing relation is split into two or
 * more
 * <li>4. Relation deletion - relations are deleted when a relation is split into two or more and we
 * need to get rid of the original one
 * <li>5. Relation tag updates - a relation country code change or synthetic tag addition will be
 * recorded here *
 * <li>6. Relation member addition - a new line member could have been added to a relation to make
 * an open multipolygon closed again
 * <li>7. Relation member deletion - a relation member could have been deleted if two or more
 * members were merged into one
 * <li>8. Line deletion - in the rare case, we might delete a line that was added during country
 * slicing of ways and is no longer needed
 * </ul>
