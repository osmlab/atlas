The 'find' command supports predicate matching using Groovy integration. When you supply
code to the '--predicate' option, you are supplying a Groovy boolean expression which will be applied
as a Predicate<AtlasEntity>. Your expression will be wrapped in some Groovy code that handles
imports for you, as well as conversion from the expression to the Java Predicate<AtlasEntity>.
Note that the AtlasEntity against which you are testing is explicitly bound to a variable called
'e'. See the following examples:

Match all entities that are members of at least 3 relations:
#--predicate 'e.relations().size() > 3'
Match all edges that are connected to edge with ID 1:
#--predicate 'e instanceof Edge && e.connectedEdges().collect { it.getIdentifier() }.contains(1L)'
