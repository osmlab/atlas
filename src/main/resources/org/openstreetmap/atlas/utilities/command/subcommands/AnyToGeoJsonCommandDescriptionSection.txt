Convert one of the many atlas-related custom file types to GeoJSON. This is very useful when trying to view
these file types in visualization software. Currently, this command supports country boundary files,
any type of sharding, as well as atlases. See the provided options and examples for various customizations.
If you are interested in atlas to text conversion and this command does not provide what you need, try the 'packed2text' command.
