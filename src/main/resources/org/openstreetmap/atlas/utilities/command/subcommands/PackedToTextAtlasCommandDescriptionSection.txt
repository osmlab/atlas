Transform a PackedAtlas (or multiple PackedAtlases) into a TextAtlas (or multiple TextAtlases).
By default, the created text atlas files will be written to the current working directory.
The names of the new text atlas files will be the same as the input files, but with an extra
'.txt' extension.

If any of the provided input atlas files cannot be found, packed-to-text will simply skip
over them with a warning. This behavior can be changed with the '--strict' option.

To save as GeoJSON instead of using the TextAtlas format, see the '--geojson' option.
