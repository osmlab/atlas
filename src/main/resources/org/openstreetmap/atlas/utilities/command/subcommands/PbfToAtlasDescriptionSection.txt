Convert PBF file(s) into sectioned Atlas file(s). The default behavior
will output the files to the same directory, but a custom output directory can be supplied. 
By default, the created Atlas files will be written to the current working directory. The 
names of the new Atlas files will prepend the country name, use the same name as the PBF file,
and use the filetype ".atlas".
