The fatlas command provides an easy way to concatenate atlas files together
using the MultiAtlas class. The command takes an arbitrary number of input
atlas files, reads them into a MultiAtlas, and then saves that MultiAtlas to
a file called 'output.atlas' in the current working directory. The '--output'
option can be used to change this directory. See the ATLAS LOADER section
for more info.
