Given an input directory of Atlas files and a relation ID, find all relation members for the relation
inside the Atlas files and attempt to create a multipolygon. Assumes the relation should be a 
multipolygon (e.g. is tagged type->multipolygon). Should the data not construct an OGC or OSM valid
multipolygon, an error will be logged and the command will halt; should the data be OSM valid but not
OGC valid, then only an error will be logged. Small relation WKTs will be printed to the console, and 
all valid relation multipolygons will be saved as WKT and Atlas files to the local directory.
