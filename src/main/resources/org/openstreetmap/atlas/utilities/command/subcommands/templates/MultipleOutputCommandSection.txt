This man section is generated for any command which inherits multiple output behaviour. 
This behaviour provides an '--output' option, which can be used to change the default
location of any output files. This example changes the output location of an example
command to your desktop:
#$ example-output-command myatlas1.atlas --output ~/Desktop
