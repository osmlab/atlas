Given a shard (or multiple shards) in any format, output the WKT of the shard's boundary. This
boundary will always be a rectangle. The shards should be specified using their getName() string
format, e.g. the SlippyTile shard for [Zoom: 9, X: 168, Y: 233] would be specified as '9-168-233'.

This command also supports a reverse match for SlippyTile and GeoHashTile shards using the
'--reverse' option. The reverse match expects WKT polygon(s) as input, and will spit out any shards
whose bounds exactly match a given WKT. If no matches are found, the command will print nothing and
exit.

Use the '--country-boundary' option to instead show the WKT boundary for given country code(s). The
code(s) should be provided in ISO3 format. If you are unsure of the ISO code for your desired
country, try using the 'iso-country-code' command.
