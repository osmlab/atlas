Search a collection of atlases for given sets of either Atlas or OSM identifiers.
Features that match the given IDs are reported in string form, along with the
atlas file that contained them. You can narrow the search to specific ItemTypes
by specifying the '--types' option. The '--collect-matching' option will use
the MultiAtlas to save all matching atlases to a file called 'collected-multi.atlas'.
