#$ find foo.atlas --geometry='POINT (0 0):POINT (1 1)' --taggableFilter='population->*'
Find features with OSM ID 123, then collect all containing atlases and save with MultiAtlas:
#$ find ~/Desktop/*.atlas --osmid 123 --collect-matching
Find all roads that lie withing a given bounding box:
#$ find foo.atlas --bounding-polygon='POLYGON ((0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 0, 0 0))' --taggableFilter='highway->*'
Find all relations that contain all of some given members:
#$ find foo.atlas --and-relation-members 'LINE,1234,*;AREA,456,role1'
Find all relations that contain a member node or edge with role 'via':
#$ find foo.atlas --relation-members 'NODE,*,via;EDGE,*,via'
