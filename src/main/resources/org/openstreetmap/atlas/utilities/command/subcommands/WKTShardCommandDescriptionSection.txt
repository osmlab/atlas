Perform various intersection lookups, specifically look for WKT or shard intersections with shards
in a given sharding or countries in a given boundary map. Read on for more information on these use-cases.

Given some supplied WKT or sharding strings and a sharding tree, spit out the shards that intersect
each geometry string. The '--tree', '--slippy', and '--geohash' options allow the user to select between
a dynamic sharding tree, a static slippy tile tree based on a single zoom, or a geohash tree with
a given precision.

Given a country boundary map and some WKT or shard strings, spit out the countries that intersect
the given geometry strings. The '--country-boundary' option should point to a valid
country boundary file as expected by the CountryBoundaryMap class.

Use the '--input' option to specify a file from which to read WKT or shard strings,
line-by-line. This will supplement any input provided on the
command line. Each line in the input file will be interpreted as
a single WKT entity or shard string.
