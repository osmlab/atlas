Given some supplied WKT strings and a sharding tree, spit out the shards that intersect
each WKT entity. The '--tree' and '--slippy' options allow the user to select between
a dynamic sharding tree or a static slippy tile tree based on a single zoom.

Use the '--input' option to specify a file from which to read WKT,
line-by-line. This will supplement any WKT strings provided on the
command line. Each line in the input file will be interpreted as
a single WKT entity.
