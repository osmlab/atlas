Look for WKT or shard intersections with a given sharding or a given country boundary
map. Read on for more information on these use-cases.

1) Given a sharding tree and some supplied WKT or shard strings, spit out the shards that intersect
each geometry string. The '--sharding' option should specify a string that is parsable by
Sharding#forString (e.g. dynamic@/path/to/tree.txt, slippy@10, geohash@5, etc.).

2) Given a country boundary map and some WKT or shard strings, spit out the countries that intersect
the given geometry strings. The '--country-boundary' option should point to a valid
country boundary file as expected by the CountryBoundaryMap class.

Use the '--input' option to specify a file from which to read WKT or shard strings,
line-by-line. This will supplement any input provided on the
command line. Each line in the input file will be interpreted as
a single WKT entity or shard string.
