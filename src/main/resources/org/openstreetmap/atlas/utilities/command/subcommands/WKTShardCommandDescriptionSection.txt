Given some supplied WKT strings and a sharding tree, spit out the shards that intersect
each WKT entity. The '--tree' and '--slippy' options allow the user to select between
a dynamic sharding tree or a static slippy tile tree based on a single zoom. If both options
are supplied, the '--tree' option takes precedence.
