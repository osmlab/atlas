Print out the tree views for a set of given TaggableMatcher description strings.
The strings will run through the TaggableMatcher parsing system.

If a tree is too long to fit in your terminal window, try piping it into less
with linewrap disabled using less's -S option.

Alternatively, you may supply the '--reverse' flag in order to convert old-style
TaggableFilters into TaggableMatchers.
