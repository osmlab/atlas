This command serves as a demo of the subcommand API and capabilities.
This example section is filled out to demonstrate the behavior of the
automatic documentation formatting code.

Unfortunately, Java does not provide a way to declare multi-line string literals. Due to this
shortcoming, declaring these paragraphs in code can be a pain. Thankfully,
an API is provided that allows you to read in doc page sections from a resource
file. The paragraph you are currently reading was generated in this manner.

This command also shows off a more advanced feature of the command API, namely contexts.
Contexts are just a way to provide multiple, mutually exclusive usage styles for a command.
In this demo command, notice that the SYNOPSIS section has a command line for specifying a
favorite meal along with some foods and cheese/beer options. But it also contains a command line
for a --breakfast usage, which changes the expected number of arguments. The option parser will
take the current command line and attempt to match it to each parse context, in the order displayed
by SYNOPSIS.
