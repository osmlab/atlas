# Sample Project

- Copy the `sample` project folder locally, and open it as a Gradle project in your favorite IDE.
- Grab one or more Atlas files from the links at the top of [that](/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas#using-atlas) readme
- Open the [`Sample.java`](src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/sample/Sample.java) file, and take a look at what it is doing.
- Run the `Sample` class with the following switch:

```
-atlas=/path/to/some.atlas
```
