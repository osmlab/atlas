# What is this script for?
#
# This script provides autocomplete functionality for Atlas Shell Tools in the
# zsh shell.
#
# How do I use it?
#
# Run the following command:
#    $ source "$ATLAS_SHELL_TOOLS_HOME/ast_completions.zsh"
# Then add 'source "$ATLAS_SHELL_TOOLS_HOME/ast_completions.zsh"' to your '~/.zshrc'
# file to pick up the completions in every new shell!

# TODO figure out how to do zsh completions
